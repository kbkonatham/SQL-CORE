                 -------Case Statement limitations-------------

We cannot control the execution flow of stored procedures, functions using a Case statement in SQL

We can have multiple conditions in Case statement; however, it works in a sequential model. If one condition is satisfied, it stops checking further conditions

We cannot use a Case statement for checking NULL values in a table
                 
                 --------------------------------Conclusion-------------------------

The Case statement in SQL provides flexibility in writing t-SQL for DDL and DML queries. It also adds versatility to SQL Server queries. You should practice Case statement in your queries.
