CASE can be used in any statement or clause that allows a valid expression. 
For example, you can use CASE in statements such as 



insert       
            values( @no , case when @gender=0 then 'F'
                                      when @gender=0 then 'F' end 
                            @sal
                   )

UPDATE set gender=(case when gender='F' then 'M' else 'F' end)

 --from , on , join , where , group by , having, select , distinct , top , order by 
 
select     derived column
where      derived column
group by   derived column
having     derived column

order by 
                 1) ( case when city='hyd' then 1 when city='Amaravathi' then 2 ) --- in general terms 1) Amaravathi, 2) hyd 

                 2)  SELECT BusinessEntityID, SalariedFlag  
                     FROM HumanResources.Employee  
                     ORDER BY CASE SalariedFlag WHEN 1 THEN BusinessEntityID END DESC  
                              ,CASE WHEN SalariedFlag = 0 THEN BusinessEntityID END;  




                 -------Case Statement limitations-------------

We cannot control the execution flow of stored procedures, functions using a Case statement in SQL

We can have multiple conditions in Case statement; however, it works in a sequential model. If one condition is satisfied, it stops checking further conditions

We cannot use a Case statement for checking NULL values in a table
                 
                 --------------------------------Conclusion-------------------------

The Case statement in SQL provides flexibility in writing t-SQL for DDL and DML queries. It also adds versatility to SQL Server queries. You should practice Case statement in your queries.
