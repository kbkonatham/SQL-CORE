----------Nulls---------------
assume all columns are allow null values

types of data 1)true 2)false 3)unkown
nulls are not compare by using logical operators.

null<>null(unknown value as false)
on
where
having

null=null
group by

	select count(no)  from  emp_null
	group by no

order by
            ascending order  all nulls are come first
            descending           all nulls are come last

 set operators


----null valus treated as true check cinstraint----

check constraint all null valus
create table emp_null(no int ,age int check (age>10 and age <60))
insert into emp_null values (1,40)
insert into emp_null(no) values (2) --- check constraint allow null as true

-----sargability -------
 =  operator we cant compare two nulls
but is we can  compare

intersect vs collace


===
null in while
condition is true continue
 condition is false come out from loop


null in if else

condition is true  go to if block
 condition is false come  else block



case
conditon is true  go to 
conditon is flase go to else block

 merge

unique constraint  allow one null
