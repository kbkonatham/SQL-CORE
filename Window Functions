The subset of rows is known as a window and is based on a window descriptor that relates to the current row.  
The syntax for window functions uses a clause called OVER, in which you provide the window specification.

SELECT city, SUM(order_amount) total_order_amount
FROM [dbo].[Orders] GROUP BY city

Types of Window functions

Aggregate Window Functions
SUM(), MAX(), MIN(), AVG(). COUNT()

AVG(order_amount) OVER(PARTITION BY city, MONTH(order_date)) as   average_order_amount 
COUNT(order_id) OVER(PARTITION BY city) as total_orders

Ranking Window Functions
RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), NTILE()

NTILE(4) OVER(ORDER BY order_amount) [row_number]

Value Window Functions
LAG(), LEAD(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE()
PERCENTILE_CONT (Transact-SQL)
PERCENTILE_DISC (Transact-SQL)
PERCENT_RANK (Transact-SQL)
CUME_DIST (Transact-SQL)   CUME_DIST computes the relative position of a specified value in a group of values

 LAG(order_date,1)       OVER(ORDER BY order_date) prev_order_date
 FIRST_VALUE(order_date) OVER(PARTITION BY city ORDER BY city) first_order_date,
LAST_VALUE(order_date)   OVER(PARTITION BY city ORDER BY city) last_order_date


       CUME_DIST () OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Rate) AS CumeDist, 
       PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Rate ) AS PctRank

       PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ph.Rate)  OVER (PARTITION BY Name) AS MedianCont
       PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ph.Rate) OVER (PARTITION BY Name) AS MedianDisc
