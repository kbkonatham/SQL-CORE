The APPLY operator is a very powerful table operator. Like all table operators, this operator is used
in the FROM clause of a query. The two supported types of APPLY operator are CROSS APPLY and
OUTER APPLY. CROSS APPLY implements only one logical query processing phase, whereas OUTER
APPLY implements two.
