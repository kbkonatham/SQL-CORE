UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
Specifies that the window starts at the first row of the partition. UNBOUNDED PRECEDING can only be specified as window starting point.

<unsigned value specification> PRECEDING
Specified with <unsigned value specification>to indicate the number of rows or values to precede the current row. This specification is not allowed for RANGE.

CURRENT ROW
Specifies that the window starts or ends at the current row when used with ROWS or the current value when used with RANGE. CURRENT ROW can be specified as both a starting and ending point.

BETWEEN <window frame bound > AND <window frame bound >
Used with either ROWS or RANGE to specify the lower (starting) and upper (ending) boundary points of the window. <window frame bound> defines the boundary starting point and <window frame bound> defines the boundary end point. The upper bound cannot be smaller than the lower bound.

UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
Specifies that the window ends at the last row of the partition. UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING can only be specified as a window end point. For example RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING defines a window that starts with the current row and ends with the last row of the partition.

<unsigned value specification> FOLLOWING
Specified with <unsigned value specification> to indicate the number of rows or values to follow the current row. When <unsigned value specification> FOLLOWING is specified as the window starting point, the ending point must be <unsigned value specification>FOLLOWING. For example, ROWS BETWEEN 2 FOLLOWING AND 10 FOLLOWING defines a window that starts with the second row that follows the current row and ends with the tenth row that follows the current row. This specification is not allowed for RANGE.

unsigned integer literal
Is a positive integer literal (including 0) that specifies the number of rows or values to precede or follow the current row or value. This specification is valid only for ROWS.
